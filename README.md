# AppVeyor-Dark

A dark theme for [AppVeyor](https://appveyor.com), specifically `ci.appveyor.com`.

This was put together in an evening so there's areas that may be unstyled or that aren't styled completely.

## How to use

For now you'll need to manually add this into [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne/).

Go into the manage styles page, select `Write new style`, and then paste the contents of [appveyor-dark.css](appveyor-dark.css) into the editor.
